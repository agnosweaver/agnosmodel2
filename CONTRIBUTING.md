# Contributing Guide

Thanks for your interest!  
This project’s main repository is kept stable and maintained only by the project owner.  
**Direct pull requests to this repository are not accepted.**
Please note this is a source-available, proprietary project (Polyform NC). The core is kept stable and maintained by the project owner; contribution invitations—when open—will appear in Issues/Discussions.

## Why contributions are limited
The design of this project is **configuration-driven** and may later be supported by a **cloud platform** that hosts official as well as community driven wrappers, plugins, and integrations.  
To keep the core clean, stable, and predictable, changes to the main repository are tightly controlled.  
This is to ensure long-term maintainability and a solid foundation which others can build upon. If the foundation keeps changing frequently, the structures built on top of it will collapse!

## How to Contribute
Contribution opportunities (wrappers, plugins, examples, integrations, etc.) may be announced in the [Issues](./issues) or [Discussions](./discussions) section of this repo.  
If you don’t see an open call for contributions there, please wait — it means contributions are not being accepted at the moment.

In short:
- ✅ Check Issues/Discussions → if contribution opportunities exist, follow them.  
- ❌ If nothing’s listed, contributions are closed.  

## Bug Reports & Suggestions
You are always welcome to open issues for bug reports or feature requests.  
Please provide clear steps, context, and expected behavior.

💡 The rule of thumb: **If you don’t see an active invitation, please don’t send PRs.**
