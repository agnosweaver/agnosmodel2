# License FAQ

Below are answers to common questions about what you can and cannot do under this license.

---

### Is this open source?
No. This is source-available software under the Polyform Noncommercial 1.0.0 license. You can read and use the code for noncommercial purposes, but commercial use is prohibited without a commercial license.

---

### Can I fork this project?
Yes. You are free to fork the project and make changes, as long as your fork is used for **noncommercial purposes**.
Your fork must keep the same license.

---

### Can I re-license this code under MIT/Apache/etc.?
No. You cannot change the license on this project.
If you publish a fork, it must remain under the Polyform Noncommercial License.

---

### Can I import this library into my own open-source project?
Yes, as long as your project is also for **noncommercial use**.
If your project depends on this code, you must state clearly that this dependency is licensed under Polyform Noncommercial.

---

### Can I build a wrapper or adapter around this code?
Yes, you may build wrappers or adapters.
Your wrapper code may use a different license (e.g. MIT), but **any use of this project underneath is still restricted to noncommercial purposes.**
A wrapper does not remove or override the original license terms. As such, it is your duty to inform your users of this dependency. Because even if your wrapper is MIT (or similar), your users are still bound by the Polyform Noncommercial terms when they use this dependency.

---

### Can I use this in my company or in a commercial SaaS product?
No, not without a commercial license from me.
If you are unsure, please contact me: agnosweaver@gmail.com.
As long you do not have my explicit permission, you cannot use it for commercial purpose.

---

### Can I use this for free if I don’t make money directly from it?
No, “commercial” includes both direct and indirect use for profit.  
This covers SaaS, hosted services, ad-supported services, internal business tools, or selling derivative works.  
If your use has any commercial aspect, you must obtain a commercial license from me.

---

### What if I didn’t know?
Claiming ignorance of this license does not exempt you from compliance. All use remains subject to Polyform Noncommercial.

---

### Is there a hosted/cloud version available?
If it is not already here yet, it is coming soon. A hosted platform is planned. If it is currently unavailable, it probably hasn't been released yet.

---

### What if I see this code offered under a different license?
If you see this project or its forks being distributed under a permissive license (MIT, Apache, etc.), that is either a mistake or violation.
The underlying code is still covered by the Polyform Noncommercial License.

### What about dependencies used by this project?
This project may depend on third-party libraries.  
Their licenses are provided in [`THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md).  
These dependencies have their own license terms which you must also follow.
